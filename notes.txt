Project Plan
1. Prototype (Moving)
  $-Triangle Boat
    $-Player can move boat with arrow keys
  -Reset Button to put boat back to start
  $-Tile Generation
    $-As boat moves from spawn point tiles will build in that direction
  -Tile Removal
    -As boat leaves a space for a long time, old tiles are removed

2. Weapons, tile removal, rock spawn, health, timer,
    targeting, 




Boat spawn: (0,0)
$-Build map around boat
  $-Build 5x5 matrix around the boat (Lets go with 500x boxes)
  -needs to be odd to have a center square.

  **Maybe name tiles by their location, so that we can search for tiles.


  -If boat collides with new tile, gather previously inhabited
    tile and new collided tile. Compare the two to get direction the boat is traveling.
    Check to see if tiles already inhabit that place. If there are missing tiles, fill them in.
